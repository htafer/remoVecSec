* remoVecSec

remoVecSec is a small wrapper around vecscreen that allows to remove
vector contamination in assembled genome. It takes as input a genome
file, a vecscreen database and returns on stdout the corrected genome
and on stderr warnings regarding vector sequences not removed.



** TODO TODO: add more cases where vector are removed
